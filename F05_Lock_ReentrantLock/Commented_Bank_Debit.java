 * Bank_Debit
 *
 * Demonstrates using ReentrantLock to protect a critical section (debiting a shared balance)
 * with a bounded wait using tryLock(timeout). This avoids indefinite blocking under contention
 * and ensures the lock is always released in a finally block.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - The sleep inside the critical section simulates a long-running task while holding the lock.
 * - In production, prefer catching InterruptedException explicitly and re-interrupting the thread.
 * - Consider fairness policy (new ReentrantLock(true)) if starvation should be minimized.
